# population_data

## Description

## Requirements

`Python 3.8.10` is required, might work on previous versions, but hasn't been tested.

Additional requirements:

- sqlite3
- matplotlib
- tkinter (because of `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')`, not necessary if not run in a virtual environment)
- numpy
- sklearn
